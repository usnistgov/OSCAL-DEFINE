# Discussion is vital.

## Our goal is deeper understanding. Please help us to:

- **Ensure** that everyone feels welcome.
- **Encourage** sharing of individual perspectives and experiences.
- **Allow** everyone space to join in, as well as to finish speaking.
- **Ask** questions that expand ideas or uncover gaps.

---

# Research is essential.

## Our goal is better decision-making. We are seeking:

- **Problem Statements** as catalysts for the future of OSCAL.
- **Documentation** of concepts requiring thought and discovery. 
- **Feedback** as a contribution to the best approach or alternatives.
- **Time** to consider all input and to make informed decisions.

    - `implementation-status`
    - assemblies
- Added `provided` outside of export.
- Added `responsibility` outside of export
