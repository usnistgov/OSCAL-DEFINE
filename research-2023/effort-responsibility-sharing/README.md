# Define: An Approach to Communicating Responsibilities and Inheritance in OSCAL

> Status: Initiation

## Problem Statement

OSCAL SSP authors need the ability to export particular content pertaining to controls that can be inherited by another system, without exposing all content of the full SSP or of those inheritable controls. This exported content must be suitable for customers to import into a new SSP of the system which inherits controls.
