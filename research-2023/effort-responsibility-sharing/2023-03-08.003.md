## Define: Customer Responsibility Model

## Problem

As an OSCAL model developer, I need examples of the an SSP that contain content available for export to a responsibility model based on #1336 and #1385. Responds to: https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1467

## Constraints

- This spiral only addresses examples of exports, and not the format of a model for sharing the exports.
- Information used is synthetic, and not based on actual SSP content.
- We encourage contributions of realistic content that has been thoroughly sanitized of any sensitive, or identifiable information.  

## Requirements

- Produce an example based on the common fields that were identified in OSCAL Issue [1336](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1336).
- Produce an example that demonstrates a potential approach that does not require modification to the existing SSP model. (or requires minimal modification).

## Approach                    

- Synthetic responses to implementation requirements were prepared for a set of controls.
- A repository of reusable synthetic controls was created based on work in the BloSS@M project.
  - https://github.com/usnistgov/csv-synthetic-controls/tree/feature-oscal-generators (May not be public until reviewed)
- Python scripts were written to support easier experimentation and export of SSP content.

## Participants

- No other participants in this spiral, other than the authors.

## Analysis

To help ensure that we do not lose sight of the focus in the examples, we seek the ability to communicate the common fields from the [review of publicly available Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM) documents](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1336). The table is repeated below:

| Field                                          | Description                                                                                                                                          | Sample                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control ID                                     | Typically the identifier of a control imported from a catalog of controls (e.g. NIST 800-53).                                                        | AC-8, CP-8                                               |
| Control Name                                   | Typically the name/title of a control imported from a catalog of controls (e.g. NIST 800-53).                                                        | System Use Notification                                  |
| Control Description                            | Typically the description of a control imported from a catalog of controls (e.g. NIST 800-53).                                                       | _See 800-53 Catalog_                                     |
| Control Origination (Ownership/Responsibility) | Assigns responsibility for a control.                                                                                                                | Provider, Shared, Customer                               |
| Implementation Model/Entity                    | Assigns the responsibility for the defined implementation detail to a group or entity.                                                               | IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Customer Provided                      |
| Implementation Details                         | This is a narrative field that outlines the manner and context of implementation of a control's requirements.                                        | _Variable prose, may contain paragraphs_                 |
| Implementation Status                          | Indicates the extent of progress for a control's implementation.                                                                                     | Implemented, Partially Implemented, Planned, Alternative |
| Implementation Requirement (Responsibility)    | Outlines the required customer actions to address the requirement, or a portion of a requirement when the implementation is a shared responsibility. | _Variable prose, may contain paragraphs_                 |
| Inheritable                                    | Indicates whether the control is inheritable.                                                                                                        | Yes, No, Partial                                         |
| Baseline                                       | Indicates the level of baseline that a control can address. (e.g., FedRAMP)                                                                          | Low, Moderate, High                                      |
| Baseline Entity/Framework                      | While the "Baseline" most relates to FedRAMP, this could relate to other regulatory frameworks                                                       | FedRAMP                                                  |


### Single Control Examples

An example of an export using [Use Case 1: PE-11](2022-07-05.001.md#outcome), based on the approach [outlined in the previous sprial](2022-07-05.002.md#general-approach).

```yaml
control-implementation:
 implemented-requirements:
   - uuid: NISTDEMO-IR01-0000-0000-000000000000
     control-id: pe-11
     by-components:
      - component-uuid: NISTDEMO-BC01-0000-0000-000000000000
        uuid: NISTDEMO-CD01-0000-0000-000000000000
        description: >-
          The infrastructure is supported by multiple uninterruptible power supplies, and a redundant 
          backup generator system capable of continuous operation for an extended period of time.
        # Export Assembly
        export:
          description: Infrastructure as a Service - This is actually the redacted content to share for the control.
          responsibilities:
            - uuid: NISTDEMO-RES1-0000-0000-000000000000
              provided-uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
              description: >-
                Customer fully inherits this control from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
              # Additional fields
              import-ref: NISTDEMO-EXT01-0000-0000-000000000000
              action: fully-inherit
          provided:
            - uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
              # Implementation Status Assembly
              implementation-status:
                - state: implemented
                  remark: "Optional communication of intent"
              description: >-
                Customers do not have physical access to any system resources in Provider datacenters.
```

An example based on [community feedback](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL-DEFINE/discussions/11#discussioncomment-5336282) to consider an option that uses existing assemblies of the SSP model.  This assumes *common fields* with more structured information in the SSP would not typically contain sensitive information, for example, the implementation status of a control. Unstructured fields containing potentially sensitive information use the existing description fields in the export assembly.

The concern is that any transformation of the SSP into a CRM-style model would have to follow a set of rules to prevent inadvertently publishing unintended information.  Placing all exportable content under the export, is a clear intent to publish customer-facing content.

```yaml
control-implementation:
 implemented-requirements:
   - uuid: NISTDEMO-IR01-0000-0000-000000000000
     control-id: pe-11
     by-components:
      - component-uuid: NISTDEMO-BC01-0000-0000-000000000000
        uuid: NISTDEMO-CD01-0000-0000-000000000000
        description: >-
          The infrastructure is supported by multiple uninterruptible power supplies, and a redundant 
          backup generator system capable of continuous operation for an extended period of time.
        # Implementation Status Assembly
        implementation-status:
          - state: implemented
            remark: "Optional communication of intent"
        # Export Assembly
        export:
          description: Infrastructure as a Service - This is actually the redacted content to share for the control.
          responsibilities:
            - uuid: NISTDEMO-RES1-0000-0000-000000000000
              provided-uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
              description: >-
                Customer fully inherits this control from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
          provided:
            - uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
              description: >-
                Customers do not have physical access to any system resources in Provider datacenters.
```

The remarkable difference is that the implementation-status assembly appears outside of the export assembly, and the action, import-ref changes in the previous example would be omitted.

## Outcome

The goal of this spiral was to produce examples of exports, one question did arise that if all exportable content was not located under the export assembly, is there still a need to explicitly define which content is exportable?

Two potential options:

  - The export assembly defines the exported fields.
  - An attribute, such as `exportable`, could be added to content to be exported.
