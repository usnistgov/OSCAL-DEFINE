An example of an export using PE-11 (Use Case 1).

```yaml
control-implementation:
 implemented-requirements:
   - uuid: NISTDEMO-IR01-0000-0000-000000000000
     control-id: pe-11

        uuid: NISTDEMO-CD01-0000-0000-000000000000
        description: >-
     The infrastructure is supported by multiple uninterruptible power supplies, and a redundant 
     backup generator system capable of continuous operation for an extended period of time.
     export:
       # Anything under this is expected to be shared.
       description: Infrastructure as a Service - This is actually the redacted content to share for the control.
       responsibilities:
         - uuid: NISTDEMO-RES1-0000-0000-000000000000
           provided-uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
           action: fully-inherit
           description: >-
             Customer fully inherits this control from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
       provided:
         - uuid: NISTDEMO-PRO1-0000-0000-000000000000
           implementation-status:
             - state: implemented
               remark: "Optional communication of intent"
           description: >-
