# Define: Mapping Model Revisions

---
## Problem

Relates to: OSCAL control mapping model support for identifying controls in a catalog that are not mapped, and other relational concerns when mapping a source and target. [^Issue-1332][^Issue-1333]

All issues related to mapping requirements and feedback need to be consolidated and synthesized. Findings were produced at the end of 2022, but not shared. These need to be summarized as a part of the effort.

## Capability: Gap Specification

Feedback was received to consider a tag that would support identifying gaps in a mapping.

```xml
      <map>
        <relationship>superset-of</relationship>
        <source type=”control” ref-id=”cis-12.5”/>
        <source type=”control” ref-id=”cis-12.7”/>
        <target type=”control” ref=”IAM-14”/>
        <target-gap>This describes what additional elements of IAM-14 need to be added in order to close the gap.</target-gap>
      </map>
```

- `source-gap` element that describes the gap textually on the source side, when the relationship “subset-of” or “intersects” is used.

- `target-gap` element that describes the gap textually on the target side, when the relationship “superset-of” or “intersects” is used.

---

## Capability: Additional Relationship Definition

Gap specification seems to support the implication of directionality, and under what conditions this might be supported.  The problem is automated interpretation of the context of the gap - is it not stating what is possible, or stating that it is not possible because of some incompatibility.  If the previous gap tag is supported, it may need a type that can define conditions such as addressable, incompatible, or undetermined. [^handout]

## Terminology: Community Feedback [^feedback-1]

- `Comparable`: Two policy statement express essentially the same requirement.
- `Acceptable`: Two policy statements express different requirements, but from a security perspective, they are both okay. The differences are not material. <Very subjective!>
- `Disparate`: Two policy statements express different requirements, and one of them is deficient as stated, when compared with the other.
- `Unknown`: Two policy statements are expressed differently, and one of them is missing a key detail. We therefore cannot determine whether or not the second policy statement is comparable to the first.

Distinction of `Disparate` and `Unknown`: When a policy is very clearly written, and it is obviously different, it is disparate. If details are missing and cannot make a determination, it is unknown.

---

## Terminology: National Online Informative References (OLIR) Relationships [^nistir8278]

- Equal
- Subset of
- Superset of
- Intersects with
- Not related to

---

## Terminology: National Online Informative References (OLIR) Relationship Rationales [^nistir8278]

- `Syntactic`: Compares the linguistic meaning of the two elements. 
- `Semantic`: Compares the contextual meaning of the two elements.
- `Functional`: Compares the functions of the two elements.

---

## Terminology: Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)

- Other relationship terms, based on SKOS: [^skos]
  - skos:broader
  - skos:narrower
  - skos:related

- Close (hierarchical)
- Exact (hierarchical)
- Broad (hierarchical)
- Narrow (hierarchical)
- Related (associative)

---
## Concerns Regarding Directional Nature of Some Relations

- Directionality of Relationships [^exercise]
  - One way
  - Both ways

---

## Capability: Context of Use

> “Explicitly stating the purpose of the map is important to create shared expectations between the creator of the map and the user of the map regarding what the map is intended to accomplish.”[^ahima]

Recommendation: Add a required purpose to mapping assembly, so that each mapping has proper context. This will address the concern stated above. Could be assigned enumerated values rather than an unstructured text field, but the list would need to be determined. (Informational, Translational, etc)

---

## Capability: Clarity of Ownership

Recommendation: Add the authoritative owner of the source and target.  This would make it clear whether the mapping is completed by an authoritative owner of the source/target, and when a mapping is produced by a third party. [^sssom]

Possibly: mapping.source-resource.responsible-parties
Possibly: mapping.target-resource.responsible-parties

---

## Capability: Manner of Creation

> “Understanding how a mapping was created (e.g. automatically or by a human expert curator) is crucial to interpreting it.” [^sssom]

Add a provenance for the mapping assembly.
Possibly: source-author, target-author, organization, individual, automation 
Also, if automated, should confidence score be included per SSSOM paper?

---

## Capability: Explicitly Not Mapped [^Issue-1333]

> “Must be able to distinguish between absence due to lack of information vs deliberate omission” [^sssom]

- This could be: not mapped, incomplete, rejected, unmappable, or omitted.
- Could this be stated in a regex, or blanket way?

---

## Capability: Parameterization and Specification Level of Controls

Considerations for mapping when parameterized statements or controls are mapped to statements or controls with explicitly stated terms.  For example, a requirement for a time interval of inventory review. [^exercise]

---

# Interpretation

> **Naming of tags and attributes with specificity is not the scope of this spiral.  This can be determined in engineering, or a decision can be made to devote additional spirals to these topics, if required.**

---

## Analysis

> **Mapping can be as much of a relationship and dialog between people and organizations as it is a technical tool for decision-making.**

Two assemblies may address **most** of the desired capabilities in the existing draft mapping model.  The word of mouth, informal feedback that I have listened to  indicates that the current model supports mapping efforts, but that it needs a more capability to document equivalencies and differences between frameworks. The question is not whether this model should exist, but how an inherently subjective effort can be represented in an OSCAL model.

While OSCAL is attempting to place content into a machine readable format, there is still a person, or group of people, involved in the process for some of the activities where subjective decisions need to be made. Frameworks are authored by different organizations with different perspectives, goals and vocabulary. It seems that the ability to document enough for a machine to be aware of this context would facilitate current methods as a step forward, without being entirely mathematical or free of bias in the mapping itself.

We also have the ability to improve as OSCAL matures, and the constraints of paper documents and spreadsheets fade.

---

### New Assembly: Qualifier

The qualifier is loosely based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) subject-predicate-object[^rdf] and applies to each map object.  How closely we want to match this, or implement this was beyond the scope of just capturing the essence of an assembly that would allow expression of differences without implying connotations on the context.  For example, expressing a "gap" or "discrepancy" in a tag could invite conflict if this could be interpreted as a framework as less useful or capable than another.

Very rough concept:
```xml
<qualifier
	subject=“source|target|both”
	has=“requirement|incompatibility”
	category=“restricted|addressable|blocked”>
    Description of qualifier...
</qualifier>
```

---

### Option: String Marker in Qualifer

Additional attributes could be considered for marking a start and end to the control/statement string to highlight the portion referenced by the qualifier.

```
	start=“starting position in string”
	end=“ending position in string”
```

There are other potential approaches here, and this is likely an "overdone" aspect of our desire to implement just enough to make the model useful as a first release.

---

### New Assembly: Provenance

This assembly applies to the entire mapping and provides clear context on intended use, the author(s) of the mapping, the manner it was achieved, and the state of the mapping.  If we imagine a repository of 200 mapping documents, this provides enough context to traverse all mappings, or query them, in specific ways to eliminate undesired mappings depending on the use case.  For example, one may wish to only use content produced by people, with a complete status.  Another example might allow a CISO to visually explore future or proposed changes to a standard.

Very rough concept:
```xml
<provenance
	responsible-parties=""
	method=“human|automation”
	matching=“lexical|logical|semantic|etc”
	confidence-score=""
	status=“complete|not-complete|draft|deprecated|superseded|etc”>
    Description of context and intended use...
</provenance>
```

---

### New Relationship: Not Mapped

I incorrectly interpreted the addition of an `unspecified` relationship which would allow the addition of any unmapped control as sufficient, and this needs a quick spiral.  The cardinality requires at least one source and one target, so this will not work in all cases.  Michaela recommended a "mini-profile" to capture this information in the model, and I did not have time to pull this part together.

---

## Recommended Actions

1. Prepare a feature request to add a qualifier assembly/tag as a part of the map assembly to describe requirements, incompatibilities and gaps that are identified between a target and source.
1. Prepare a feature request to add a required provenance assembly to document contextual information and responsibility for the mapping.
1. Determine a path forward for a section of the model to specify a list of unmapped controls for source and target.
1. Consider evidence as an important dimension of equivalency in some contexts, particularly if an organization is using a mapping to prepare for meeting a new standard based on another framework.  If this particular approach requires a more in-depth synthesis using profiles and SSP documents, we should produce a guide for this.
