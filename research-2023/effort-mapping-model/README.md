# Define: Determine changes and revisions required in the development mapping model.

> Status: Discovery

## Problem Statement

The mapping model has been available through the development branch, and there are a number of requests to modify and improve the model before release.

- Relates to: https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1332 & https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/1333
- All issues related to mapping requirements and feedback need to be consolidated and synthesized.
- Findings were produced at the end of 2022, but not shared.  These need to be summarized as a part of the effort.
- A draft of updates to the model needs to be produced.
- Target June for having this in a change request for engineering.
